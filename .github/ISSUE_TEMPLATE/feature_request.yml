        Currently, users need to use separate libraries to get Qibla direction.
        It would be convenient to have this calculation in the same SDK...

        // New method
        const qiblaDirection = sdk.getQiblaDirection();
        // Returns: { bearing: 245.3, direction: "WSW" }

        // Or as part of existing response
        const times = sdk.getTimes();
        // Returns: { fajr: "05:30", ..., qibla: { bearing: 245.3 } }
